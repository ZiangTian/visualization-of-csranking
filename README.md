# visualization-of-csranking

This is a mini-project for the course visualization.

Some code is in reference to [this repository](https://github.com/BitterOcean/ComputerScienceSchools), but with modifications to include faculty members and publication count of each univeristy.

## Code Structure

- `Vis` folder contains scripts and notebook for visualizing data.
- `Scrapping` folder contains scripts and notebook to scrap data off [csranking.com](csranking.com)
- `images` folder contains all outputs, from png, svg to html.
- `Prev` folder contains previous attempts at analyzing data given in csv forms on [csranking.com](csranking.com). The data is too limited to be adopted. This folder is obsolete and should not be opened.
- Other folders are the intermediate `.csv` files that can be handily loaded as dataframes.
